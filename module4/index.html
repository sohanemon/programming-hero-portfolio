          Once upon a time in Faridpur Engineering College in Faridpur. I was
          looking for someone. Then I went to somewhere else and then I found
          one was standing beside the cafeteria.

            I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple
            website. I can even teach my grandma how to make simple website. My
            goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.

            I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything
            needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the
            web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue
            JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you
            100% web solution.

          <p>
            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
            Hero.
